**Unidirectional Mapping**
Only **one entity** knows (or references) the relationship. The link goes in **one direction**.
only one entity has the relationship field and knows about the other entity

**Bidirectional Mapping**

**Both entities** know about each other and maintain references, so the relationship goes in **two directions**.
Both entity has the relationship field and knows about the other entities.

**Owning Side**
The owning side of a relationship is the entity that **controls the association in the database**. It is responsible for **creating and managing the foreign key or join table**.

**Non-Owning Side**
The non-owning side is the entity that **does not manage the database mapping**. It only **reflects the relationship** using the `mappedBy` attribute.


Types Of Mapping 

**One-to-One Mapping**

One-to-One mapping is when one entity is associated with exactly one instance of another entity.
It can be unidirectional (only one entity knows) or bidirectional (both know each other).
The owning side contains the foreign key, defined using @OneToOne and @JoinColumn.
Example: A Person has one Passport.
